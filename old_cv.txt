SUMMARY
As an AI Engineer with consulting experience at Deloitte, I have had a lot of client-facing experience working closely with executives,
developers, and management. I have consistently had to manage multiple projects and deadlines in fast engagements. My
undergraduate and honours thesis gave me exposure to the energy, sustainability, and automation space, making me suitable for any
relevant engineering, IT, or data work. Through project work, I have often had to work in a small team, and proactively take ownership
of multiple deliverables in parallel. My written and verbal communication skills are very strong, and I have good proficiency with slide
design on PowerPoint. I also have technical skills in both AWS and Azure, Power BI, Fabric, SQL, and Python, and my familiarity with AI,
data analysis, data engineering, data visualisation, and machine learning, will greatly help with any technical work.
I have the right to work in the United Kingdom via the Youth Mobility Scheme Visa
